Hi! if you're reading this you probably want to know how to maintain these api docs.

Well, you're out of luck, since I have no idea what I'm doing! Luckily, though,
I seem to be able to bumble into the right things to do.


BUILDING THESE DOCS
-------------------

$ pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme recommonmark
$ make html


DEALING WITH LAYOUT
-------------------

So the thing about Sphinx is that it's not a python-specific framework, it's a general-purpose
documentation generator. Sphinx docs are written in ReStructured Text (rst), a
superset-cum-bastard-clone of Markdown. In order to do te neat thing where our docstrings are
added to the documentation, there's this cool Sphinx plugin called "autodoc", which does
exactly that.

SO, we have the base api-docs layout in the "source" dir, which includes several directives
provided by the autodoc plugin - this is what goes out into the angr source, picks up the
docstrings, and plops them into the output with appropriate formatting.
