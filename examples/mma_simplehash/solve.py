# simple_hash was a reversing challenge in the first MMA CTF, held in 2015.
# This binary implemented a hash function. To get the flag, the hacker needed
# to provide an input that hashed to a specific value.
#
# This provided a number of challenges to angr:
#
# 1. Because we need to automatically break a hash, constraint solves can be
#    extremely slow. This means that we need to adjust Z3's timeout so that
#    constraint solves will succeed.
# 2. The optimized way in which modular multiplication is implemented in the
#    binary causes problems for angr's symbolic execution engine and results
#    in a path explosion. To get around this, we need to hook the `mm` and
#    `moddi3` functions with python summaries.
# 3. There is a bug in angr's environment model, causing global data used by
#    `isalnum` to be improperly initialized. As a temporary fix, we need to
#    hook the `isalnum` function with a python summary.
# 4. One of the initializers in the binary causes a path explosion in the
#    symbolic execution engine. This is also likely due to a faulty environment
#    model. Our solution was to simply begin execution from within `main()`,
#    manually specifying the user input.
#
# Once these issues are addressed, things go fairly smoothly! Keep in mind that
# this is still a tough problem for symbolic execution, so the solution takes
# about an hour to run.

#
# Go go go!

import angr

# These are our symbolic summary functions for modular multiplication, modulo,
