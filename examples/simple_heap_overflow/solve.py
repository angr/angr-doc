    # angr to perform a basic heap overwrite and achieve control over rip.

    # The premise of this binary is to ask for two inputs, the second of which can
    # overflow into the area of the first. Further, a pointer will be dereferenced
    # in this process, thus giving us a target to control execution from.

    # Please note that this example is very dependent on the LIBC version, make
    # sure that you have 'libc.so.6' and 'ld-linux-x86_64.so.2' in the same
    # directory as this script.
