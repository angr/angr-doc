"""
In this challenge we are given a binary that checks an input given from stdin.
If it is correct, it will call get_flag in a separate library and print it.
However, we don't have the library so need to find the correct input and input
it over netcat. If it is incorrect, only 'Goodbye' is printed.

Reversing shows that the program verifies the input character by character.]
Because of the program's linear nature and reliance on verbose constraints, 
angr is perfect for solving this challenge quickly. On a virtual machine
with one core and 4 GB of RAM, it took ~26 seconds to solve.
