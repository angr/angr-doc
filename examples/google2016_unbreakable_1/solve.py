"""
In this challenge we are given a binary that checks an input given as a
command line argument. If it is correct, 'Thank you - product activated!' is
printed. If it is incorrect, 'Product activation failure %d' is printed with a
specific error code.

Reversing shows that the program verifies that various operations on specific 
characters of input are equal to zero. Because of the program's linear nature
and reliance on verbose constraints, angr is perfect for solving this challenge
quickly. On a virtual machine, it took ~7 seconds to solve.
