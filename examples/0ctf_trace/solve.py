"""
In this challenge we're given a text file with trace of a program execution. The file has
two columns, address and instruction executed. So we know all the instructions being executed,
and which branches were taken. But the initial data is not known.

Reversing reveals that a buffer on the stack is initialized with known constant string first,
then an unknown string is appended to it (the flag), and finally it's sorted with some
variant of quicksort. And we need to find the flag somehow.

angr easily solves this problem. We only have to direct it to the right direction
at every branch, and solver finds the flag at a glance.
