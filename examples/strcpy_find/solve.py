@desc   Tutorial solver for an example program.  I noticed most of the angr
        examples were for solving for a password/flag rather than for finding
        exploitable memory corruptions.  I hope this will lead you on the path
        to finding your own memory corruptions.  Enjoy!

     Since we want to find a path to strcpy ONLY where we have control of the
     source buffer, we have to have a custom check function which takes a Path
     as an argument.

     You might be wondering what we should do to instruct angr to find our
     target address since we're replacing the 'find=' argument with this
     'check' function.  Just check p.state.ip.args[0] (the current instruction
     pointer) to make sure we're at our intended path destination before checking
     to make sure the other conditions are satisfied.

             By looking at the disassembly, I've found that the pointer to the
             source buffer given to strcpy() is kept in RSI.  Here, we dereference
             the pointer in RSI and grab 8 bytes (len("HAHAHAHA")) from that buffer.

             Now that we have the contents of the source buffer in the form of a bit
             vector, we grab its string representation using the current state's
             solver engine's function "any_str".

             don't control the source buffer

     Call the function at the entry_state and find a path that satisfies
     the check function.  If you specify a tuple/list/set for find or avoid,
     it translates to an address to find/avoid.  If you just give a function
     it will pass a Path to the function and check to see if the function returns
     True or False and proceed accordingly.

     Here, we tell the explore function to find a path that satisfies our check
     method and avoids any paths that end up in addrBadFunc ('func3')
